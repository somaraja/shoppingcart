# Shoppingcart

Step 1: Shopping cart<br> 
● You are building a checkout system for a shop which only sells apples and
oranges.
<br>● Apples cost 60p and oranges cost 25p.
<br>● Build a checkout system which takes a list of items scanned at the till and outputs
the total cost
<br>● For example: [ Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple ] => £2.05
<br>● Make reasonable assumptions about the inputs to your solution; for example, many
candidates take a list of strings as input
<br><br>Step 2: Simple offers
<br>● The shop decides to introduce two new offers
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ buy one, get one free on Apples
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;○ 3 for the price of 2 on Oranges
<br>● Update your checkout functions accordingly
